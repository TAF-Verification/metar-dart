Inspired from python-metar, a library writed in Python language to parse Meteorological Aviation Weather Reports (METAR and SPECI).

This library will parse meteorological information of aeronautical land stations.
Supported report types:
* METAR
* SPECI
* TAF

## Current METAR reports

The current report for a station is available at the URL

```
http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/stations/<station>.TXT
```

where `station` is the ICAO station code of the airport. This is a four-letter code. For all stations at any cycle (i.e., hour) in the last  hours the reports are available at the URL

```
http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/cycles/<cycle>Z.TXT
```

where `cycle` is the 2-digit cycle number (`00` to `23`).

## Usage

A simple usage example:

```dart
import 'package:metar_dart/metar_dart.dart';

main() {
  String code = 'METAR MROC 071200Z 10018KT 3000 R07/P2000N BR VV003 17/09 A2994 RESHRA NOSIG';
  final metar = Metar(code);

  // Get the type of the report
  print('${metar.type}'); // Meteorological Aerodrome Report

  // Get the wind speed in knots and direction in degrees
  print('${metar.wind.speedInKnot} kt');       // 18.0 kt 
  print('${metar.wind.directionInDegrees}째');  // 100.0째

  // Get the pressure in hecto pascals
  print('${metar.pressure.inHPa} hPa');  // 1014.0 hPa

  // Get the temperature in Celsius
  print('${metar.temperatures.temperatureInCelsius}째C');  // 17.0째C
}
```
