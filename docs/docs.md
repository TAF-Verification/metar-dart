# Metar-Dart Documentation

## Introduction

Metar-Dart is a package for Dart programming language designed for parsing aerinautical and
meteorological information from land stations (airports and meteorological offices).

It is strongly influenced by [Python-Metar][python-metar] package, authored by [Tom Pollard][tom-pollard]. 
But, this package is designed to go further in parsing more than METAR reports.
